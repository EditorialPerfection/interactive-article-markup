# Interactive Article Markup

This repository serves as a code sandbox for testing a prototype of interactive article editing. 
It features an editable HTML markup with syntax highlighting on the left, and a rendered view of the article with the necessary CSS styles on the right, exactly as it would appear to an end-user. This sandbox is an experimental example in the development of a blogging CMS for EditorialPerfection.
